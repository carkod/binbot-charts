The Symbol Search is used to search and display instruments that match a full or partial instrument name entered in the search field.

If your use of the library doesn't involve changing the displayed instrument by users, then you can hide the search box using [header_symbol_search](Featuresets) featureset.

Otherwise, you need to specify possible [symbol types and exchanges](JS-Api#exchanges) in the API.
